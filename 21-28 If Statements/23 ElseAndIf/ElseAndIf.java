// else if and else are running code only if the requirement of the if statement above it is not met, then the requirement for else if is checked, if the requirements are all met, the else statement is run
// the else at the beginning of the else if statement is removed, then the the statement runs separate from the if statement above it, even if the requirement of the if statement above it is met, then the program will still check the new if statement and run it if it is true, as opposed to ignoring an else if statement if the above if requirement is met
